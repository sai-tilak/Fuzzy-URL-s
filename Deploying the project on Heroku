Idea behind this:
Now finally, we have come to the stage to check if everything works fine on our localhost. If so, we can try deploying it onto a live server for everyone to use.
We'll be using Heroku for deployment.
Requirements
Visit heroku.com and create an account/log in to your existing account.

Create a new app, name it accordingly (but keep it short and concise). Select the region which suits you the best.

Go to settings in heroku. Under config vars, add all the environment variables you used in .env one by one.

In your root directory, add a Procfile (without an extension) and add web: gunicorn < name of app i.e URLapp > .wsgi

Install gunicorn and dnspython using

pip install gunicorn dnspython
Since we are using virtual environment we can get a list of all installed modules.

pip freeze > requirements.txt
Create a runtime.txt file and insert the python runtime i.e python-3.8.5

Sign in to your Heroku account via terminal and follow the commands here or as given under the deploy section of your Heroku app

heroku login -i

git init

heroku git:remote -a <name of project>

git add .
git commit -am "make it better"
git push heroku master
This should deploy your code properly onto Heroku. Upon visiting the Heroku URL, you should see your web-app running
You should be able to open your app from heroku dashboard itself, via "Open App" in the upper right section.

Expected Outcome :
Your Final web app should be up and running live on server working properly without showing any error(s).

Congrats on making it till the end of this project, hope you have enjoyed making this and now its time to showcase it in your resume.
